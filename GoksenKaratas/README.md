# 1. Introduction

Emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction systems. In the scope of emotion recognition, the contextual features of images can help the model identify the emotion classes effectively. For this matter, context-aware emotion recognition (CAER)[2] approaches have been developed in a way that incorporates such context features by specifically focusing on them. However, CAER methods often suffer from context bias, leading to suboptimal results. The negative effects of such context bias can be so powerful that in some cases, the emotion classes of the given images can be predicted solely depending on the contextual features regardless of the actual object (humans in this case).

This paper introduces a novel framework, **Counterfactual Emotion Inference (CLEF)** [1], to mitigate context bias and improve robustness in CAER tasks. Specifically, a generalized causal graph is formulated to shed light to the causal relationships between variables in CAER flow. Following the graph, a non-invasive context branch is integrated to capture the adverse direct effect caused by the context bias. 

This repository contains the re-implementation of the paper "Robust Emotion Recognition in Context Debiasing", authored by Dingkang Yang, Kun Yang, Mingcheng Li, Shunli Wang, Shuaibing Wang, Lihua Zhang. The paper was published in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2024.

The primary aim of this repository is to ensure the reproducibility of the results presented in the paper by implementing the CLEF framewrok and conducting experiments as described in the paper.

## 1.1. Paper summary

Existing Context-Aware Emotion Recognition (CAER) approach uses both the subject and the surrounding context to predict emotions of a given image. While contextual features can enhance the accuracy of predictions, they might also cause context bias to be included, where spurious correlations lead to inaccurate predictions.

Some drawbacks of CAER:
* Dependence on context results in biased predictions.
* Performance bottleneck (by forcing the models to rely on spurious correlations between background contexts and emotion labels in likelihood estimation)
  
To address these issues, the paper proposes the Counterfactual Emotion Inference Framework (CLEF), which uses causal inference to separate helpful prior and harmful bias. By removing the direct context effect (bias) and preserving only the indirect context effect (helpful prior), CLEF ensures more robust emotion predictions.
In the scope of the paper, the authors extend the pre-existing CAER architecture to capture the indirect causal effects and reduce their negative effects on prediction performance. They construct a causal graph to formulate the relationships among variables in CAER. Using the causal graph, CLEF propose a non-invasive context branch aimed at capturing the direct effects of context bias. During inference, CLEF computes both factual and counterfactual outcomes to remove the direct context effect from the total causal effect. This process ensures that the model's predictions are less influenced by biased contextual information and thus enhances emotion recognition performance.

For evaluating the performance of the proposed framework, experiments are conducted on two large-scale image-based CAER datasets, including EMOTIC[3] and CAER-S[4]. The results for the five baseline models EMOT-Net[3], CAER-Net[4], GNN-CNN[5], CD-Net[6], and EmotiCon[7] show that integrating CLEF increases performance across all approaches.

# 2. The method and our interpretation

## 2.1. The original method

The proposed method formulates the problem as a causal graph and uses the implied relations to mitigate the direct effects of context bias while preserving the desired undirect prior.
First, the authors start by defining the preliminary relations obtained from causal graph theory:
<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/bahadirkaratas/GoksenKaratas/blob/main/GoksenKaratas/images/CausalGraphs.png" alt="Emotion Recognition Context Bias" width="400"> </p>

To architecturally define the framework, the authors introduce an additional context branch to the pre-existing CAER architecture in order to denote the contextual bias. Once the emotion recognition problem is formulated as a causal graph, the given relations became useful for extracting direct effects of branches.
While extending the factual component, they also introduce a counterfactual component with a very similar architecture as the factual one. The main motivation behind this choice is to incorporate the extracted realations from the causal graphs and be able to govern the effects of the contextual features. 

<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/bahadirkaratas/GoksenKaratas/blob/main/GoksenKaratas/images/Architecture.png" alt="Architecture" width="900"> </p>



The causal graph formulation of vanilla CAER framework is provided as follows:

* Input images X 
* Subject features S
* Context features C 
* Ensemble representations E 
* Emotion predictions Y  

**Link X → C → Y** reflects the shortcut between the original inputs X and the model predictions Y through the harmful bias in the context features C.

**Link C ← X → S** portrays the total context and subject representations extracted from X via the corresponding encoders in vanilla CAER models. 

**Link C/S → E → Y** captures the indirect causal effect of C and S on the model predictions Y through the ensemble representations E.

By examining the CAER causal graph links, the additional relations are introduced into the causal graph of CLEF. To mitigate the interference of the harmful context bias on model predictions, they exclude the biased direct effect along the link X → C → Y. The causality in the factual scenarios is formulated as follows:
<p align="left"> <img src="https://github.com/bahadirkaratas/GoksenKaratas/blob/main/GoksenKaratas/images/EQ5.png" alt="EQ5" width="400"> </p>

This reflects the confounded emotion predictions since it suffers from the undesired effects of the pure context bias. To be able to fix  distinct causal effects in the context semantics, the Total Effect (TE) of C = c and S = s are calculated:
<p align="left"> <img src="https://github.com/bahadirkaratas/GoksenKaratas/blob/main/GoksenKaratas/images/EQ6.png" alt="EQ6" width="400"> </p>

where c∗ and e∗ represent the non-treatment conditions for observed values of C and E, where c and s leading to e are not given.
Next, the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) for the harmful bias in context semantics is estimated in order to clarify the causalty between them
<p align="left"> <img src="https://github.com/bahadirkaratas/GoksenKaratas/blob/main/GoksenKaratas/images/EQ7.png" alt="EQ7" width="400"> </p>

To exclude the explicitly captured context bias in NDE, Total Indirect Effect (TIE) is estimated by subtracting NDE from TE
<p align="left"> <img src="https://github.com/bahadirkaratas/GoksenKaratas/blob/main/GoksenKaratas/images/EQ9.png" alt="EQ9" width="400"> </p>
The resulting TIE is than used as the unbiased prediction during inference.


**Implementation Instantiation**


CLEF’s predictions consist of two parts: 
* the prediction `Y_c(X) = N_C(c|x)` of the additional context branch (i.e., \(X → C → Y\))
* `Y_e(X) = N_{C,S}(c, s|x)` of the vanilla CAER model (i.e., \(X → C/S → E → Y\)). 

The context branch is a neural network like ResNet to receive context images with masked subjects. The masking operation contains masking out the subject by assigning the pixel values of the subject to zero. Here, masking forces the network to focus on pure context semantics for estimating the direct effect. 

Once the values for both branches are calculated, a pragmatic fusion strategy φ(·) is introduced to obtain the final score Y_{c,e}(X):
<p align="left"> <img src="https://github.com/bahadirkaratas/GoksenKaratas/blob/main/GoksenKaratas/images/Fusion.png" alt="fusion" width="400"> </p>

**Training**

The authors state that as a universal framework, they have selected multi-class classification problem as an example to adopt the cross-entropy loss as the objective function. The general loss is calculated by summing the losses of two branches independently:

<p align="left"> <img src="https://github.com/bahadirkaratas/GoksenKaratas/blob/main/GoksenKaratas/images/LossSummation.png" alt="loss" width="400"> </p>


For the counterfactual branch, the imagined Y_e*(X) is implemented as a trainable parameter initialized by the uniform distribution since neural networks cannot handle void inputs. It should be noted that the Y_e*(X) is shared by all samples. To be able to regularize Y_e*(X), since inappropriate values can cause TIE to be dominated by TE or NDE, Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed.
<p align="left"> <img src="https://github.com/bahadirkaratas/GoksenKaratas/blob/main/GoksenKaratas/images/KL.png" alt="kl" width="400"> </p>

After integrating all components together, the final loss is formulated as the following:

## 2.2. Our interpretation

The paper conducts several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The authors state that they reproduced the original CAER approaches from scratch to ensure a fair comparison. In this section, they report using the training setups from the original papers directly.

At first, we assumed that they reproduced the architecture, integrated the proposed framework with this architecture, and then started training using the aforementioned setup. However, it is unclear whether they mean training the CAER models with the stated setup first, then wrapping the framework around the trained models and further train the combined architecture, using unreported training parameters.

Throughout our experiments, we aimed to clarify which interpretation is correct. Additionally, we attempted to contact the corresponding author for clarification on this matter. We will discuss the results and the assumptions at the conclusion section.

# 3. Experiments and results

## 3.1. Experimental setup

In this paper, experiments are conducted on two large-scale image-based CAER datasets, namely EMOTIC and CAER-S. The evaluation of the proposed framework is performed using five representative methods with completely different structures and contextual modelling paradigms:

* EMOT-Net[3]
* CAER-Net[4]
* GNN-CNN[5]
* CD-Net[6]
* EmotiCon[7]

The authors state that they conducted their experiments following the original paper's experimental setups, detailed as follows:
* **EmotiCon:** The EMOTIC dataset was used to train the EmotiCon model with a batch size of 32 for 75 epochs. The training process employed the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and was conducted on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU.
* **CD-Net:** The CD-NET model was trained on the CAER-S and EMOTIC datasets using a batch size of 64 for 61 epochs. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer was applied with a learning rate of 0.001 for the backbone and 0.01 for other layers, along with a weight decay of 5×10⁻⁴. A cosine decay learning rate scheduler was employed, and the training was conducted on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU.
* **GNN-CNN:** The GNN-CNN model was trained on the EMOTIC dataset with a batch size of 64, a learning rate of 0.001, and a weight decay of 5 × 10⁻⁴.
* **CAER-Net:** The CAER-Net model was trained from scratch using an initial learning rate of 5 × 10⁻³, which was reduced by a factor of 10 every 4 epochs. The training employed the cross-entropy loss function with a batch size of 32.
  For the CAER dataset, videos were sampled at 10 frames per second, and 16 frame non-overlapping clips were extracted for training. Facial clips (VF) were resized to 96 × 96, while contextual clips (VC) were resized to 128 × 171 and then cropped to 112 × 112 during training. The CAER-S dataset was used with inputs resized to 224 × 224. During the testing phase, 16 frame clips with an 8 frame overlap were used, applying a single center crop for contextual parts.
* **EMOT-Net:** The EMOT-Net model is trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent with momentum, allowing all parameters to be learned jointly. The first two modules are initialized with pre-trained models from Places and ImageNet, while the fusion network is trained from scratch. After testing various batch sizes (e.g., 26, 78, 108), a batch size of 52 was selected based on its superior validation performance.



The effectiveness of the five given CLEF-based methods are compared against existing state-of-the-art models such as:
* HLCR [8]
* TEKG [9]
* RRLA [10]
* VRD [11]
* SIB-Net [12]
* MCA [13]
* GRERN [14]

## 3.3. Results

### 3.3.1 Results for CAER-Net Model

First of all, we implemented CLEF architecture to begin our experiments. As a starting point, we integrated an existing implementation of the CAER-Net Model[15] as the factual branch of our framework. For the non-invasive context branch utilized ResNet152. The primary goal of these initial experiments is to verify the correctness of our interpretation of the framework. For this experiment, the following setup was utilized: 
1. Batch Size = 32,
2. Learning Rate = 1e-4
3. Epoch = 65
4. Optimizer = Adam

Our preliminary experiments show that architecture is learning.

| **MODEL**          | **# EPOCHS** | **LEARNING RATE** | **ACCURACY** |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| CAER-Net + CLEF    | 50           | 1e-4              | 0.49         |
| CAER-Net + CLEF    | 50           | 5e-5              | 0.51         |

### 3.3.1 Results for EMOT-Net Model

Unlike the CAER dataset, which involves single-label classification, the Emotic dataset contains multi-labeled data. To accommodate this, we utilized a discrete loss function as specified in the original implementation, along with a sigmoid activation function, which is more appropriate for multi-label classification tasks. In this experiment, we incorporated the EMOT-Net model, utilizing and modifying the implementation[18], as a factual branch within the Counterfactual Emotion Inference (CLEF) framework. Training parameteres are: 
Obtained scores for EMOT-Net model and with CLEF model with Emotic dataset are give below:

1. Batch Size = 32,
2. Learning Rate = 1e-3
3. Epoch = 30
4. Optimizer = Adam

# 4. Conclusion

Throughout the project, we aimed at reproducing two experimental setups of the original paper. The main challenge was the lack of technical details about the experimental setup. While we report a limited number of results due to hardware restrictions, we have conducted several toy experiments during the implementations as well. We can safely verify that the proposed architecture indeed improves model performance. However, since the training parameters are not specified and, according to our understanding, some matters could benefit from some further explanations, we were unable to reproduce the exact results. Nevertheless, we believe that the results we obtained on the CAER-S dataset align with the original results and the gap originates from the specific setup, mostly number of epochs. We suspect from the number of epochs since we observed that the model's validation accuracy keeps increasing as the number of epochs increase, with some instabilities at higher epochs. We were unable to train the model further, due to limited hardware we had. The results for the EMOT-NET model is a little different. We reproduced the original baseline results using the original implementation directly. When we trained the model as a part of the proposed framework, we observed an unstable training, although the model started with a higher score than the baseline model. The validation loss during the training were decreasing with close no none improvements in the reported metric (mean average precision).  There might be a number of reasons behind this situation. First, there might be a minor bug regarding the handling of multilabel samples. This is a possibility since the model trained on CAER-S dataset does not have such instabilities. The second possibility is that the baseline model uses a loss consisting of both categorical and continuous predictions, while we only use the categorical loss alongside KL Divergence. There is again, an unclear statement on our end. The CLEF paper defines the EMOTIC dataset as containing categorical samples only. Therefore, we did not include the continuous loss in our implementation. After obtaining the unstable training setup, that shows no meaningful increase on map, we believe incorporating the hybrid loss could result in a better setup.
